# Lark

Lark is (L)isp m(ark)up

This is my seriously non-serious attempt at my own lispy markup language

_"Every lisper writes their own html DSL, it's practically a rite of passage"_
    
# Goals of Lark

- Create an HTML templating tool suitable for [disast.rs](https://disast.rs)
- Learn some stuff
- Have some fun
    
# Non-goals of Lark

Be "fully featured", "suitable for use in production", etc

    
# Other

No relation to the [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) parsing toolkit for Python.
Looks cool though.
